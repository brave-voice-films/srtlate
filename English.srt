1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,221
Josh communicated but

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,850
it's also the belief that

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,768
we never knew the severity

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,272
nor I don't think he knew how to
communicate the severity of it.

5
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,623
I had a pretty happy childhood

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,543
You know, I had trouble fitting
in but nothing outside the norm.

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,172
The night before ninth grade
started, I broke down crying.

8
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,258
I struggled a lot with these
feelings that

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,926
I didn't know what to do with.

10
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,762
I was sad, I had no energy.

11
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,848
I eventually was diagnosed with
depression.

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,600
I started hurting myself.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,144
I cut and did other forms of
self-harm

14
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,562
and I thought about suicide.

15
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,940
When I was 12, I started
feeling depressed.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,279
I was sitting in the car on
my way to a girl scout event

17
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,490
and someone mentioned a book

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,036
about a girl who
had committed suicide,

19
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,539
and I think that's the moment
that I realized that,

20
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,584
that's what I wanted to do.

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,755
There was a magazine in a
doctor's office,

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:34,010
that had an article about
kids having cutting groups

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,888
and going to the
bathroom and cutting

24
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:43,311
and I thought, I could try this
and it just became an addiction

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,106
because when I was nervous or
anxious or depressed or angry

26
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,608
that's what I would go to.

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,153
In my past, I've had experience
with eating disorders,

28
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,947
suicide, and self-harm.

29
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,243
As far as eating disorders
go, there was a time when I

30
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,955
deliberately withheld food from
myself in order to lose weight.

31
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,291
Self-harm, for about a year
and half straight I would

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
wake up in the morning with
a knife under my pillow

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,174
and cut myself on my arm
and my inner leg.

34
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,761
There were a couple of
times when I attempted to

35
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,056
commit suicide by cutting
myself and bleeding out.

36
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,476
When I was 13, I began to
struggle with

37
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,562
anorexia and depression

38
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,482
and it continued well into
the age of 17.

39
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,529
When I was 13, nearly 14
I had reached the first stage

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:40,243
of my weight loss plan, which
was to achieve 98 pounds.

41
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,120
I wanted to break 100 pounds

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,539
'cause anything more than that
seemed obese.

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,791
[Sarah] I remember I would
constantly check my weight

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,460
on online
calculators for B. M. I.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,631
to make sure that I was under
16.8 which was considered to be

46
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,049
underweight by all standards

47
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,635
and I thought that was an
accomplishment

48
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,430
so I kept it as close to that
as I could

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,265
and wanted to go even lower.

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,269
I had a fantastic childhood,

51
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,771
it's always hard to talk about
this most of the time with

52
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,275
people, or to feel legitimacy in
the struggles that I went

53
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,653
through because I hear a lot of
people who said that they were

54
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,281
abused as children and had
really rough childhoods

55
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,366
but I had... um...

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,203
a great upbringing, supportive
parents, great family life.

57
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,248
There was nothing was nothing in
my life situation

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,709
that should have pointed to the
struggles that I encountered,

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,046
particularly with depression but
it started to become

60
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,131
something that was beyond
my control

61
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,217
by the time that I reached 13
it kind of snuck up on me.

62
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,303
Again a Fairfield Township
family

63
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,930
is struggling for answers
tonight

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
after the untimely death of
their daughter.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,476
Florida authorities believe a 12
year old girl

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,477
committed suicide.

67
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,730
A community is mourning the
suicide of a 13 year old

68
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,523
who took his life at school.

69
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,109
Harleydonna McGuire whom
everyone called "Kitty"

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,654
committed suicide last Tuesday.

71
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,614
A mother found her ten year old
daughter

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,907
who had committed suicide.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,203
A new government report showed
an 8% increase in suicides among

74
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,621
children and young adults

75
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,999
and that is the largest rise in
about 15 years.

76
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,418
[Matt]
We see these stories every day.

77
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,838
Depression, anxiety, eating
disorders, self-harm

78
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,383
these are just a few of the
prominent mental illnesses that

79
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,259
teens and young adults face.

80
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,304
For many young people, these
conditions are an unexplained,

81
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,391
confusing, and often paralyzing
part of their lives.

82
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,101
[Sarah] They can grow
 to believe

83
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,477
that this is
their fault.

84
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,854
That this is something
they should be ashamed of.

85
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,816
Sometimes they're too afraid
to reach out for help.

86
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,152
Sometimes they're pressured to
hide this part of them away.

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,155
[Narrator] We started this
project as a small group

88
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,448
of high school and
college students

89
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,200
to tell our own stories and
those of our close

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,785
friends and family.

91
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,580
We have seen first hand how easy
it is to hide behind a mask.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,582
We wanted to start a
conversation.

93
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,376
We put out a call asking for
teens to share

94
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,169
their experiences with us

95
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,672
and were amazed at the
response we received.

96
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,633
Our crew expanded shooting
hundreds of hours of footage.

97
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,218
We saw the effect the stigmas
had on the

98
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,095
lives of countless
teens.

99
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,097
These are the stories we wanted
to tell.

100
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,565
I was in my mid-twenties,

101
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,819
I had a good job, I was you
know... I kind of...

102
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,988
I called it my mask life.
Everyone on the outside

103
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,281
would think I was doing fine.

104
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,033
I had a good job, I had a lot of
friends,

105
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,701
I was involved in things

106
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,536
on the inside I was miserable,

107
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,247
and I really didn't share that
with anybody

108
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,459
because I didn't trust
anybody enough to do that.

109
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,045
I was content in my life,
there was no reason why

110
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,546
I would
be unhappy.

111
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,592
But there were these symptoms
that started to kind of overtake

112
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,177
the way that I viewed myself,

113
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,679
and also my future, and it was
uncharacteristic

114
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,558
because I always was, and have
tried to be a very happy person,

115
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,269
very positive and optimistic and
that's what people knew me as.

116
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,980
So when I started to feel off,

117
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,609
I didn't know how to
explain it to anyone

118
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,360
I didn't know how to understand
it myself

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,780
so I just didn't talk
about it

120
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,199
and that was when I was 13.

121
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,241
When I was depressed,

122
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:11,079
I think my self-esteem got worse
cause everyone

123
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,580
was telling me that I should
have been okay,

124
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,665
and I was trying to be

125
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,335
and I couldn't be and I felt
like a failure

126
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,712
in that I couldn't do anything
right.

127
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,507
And I remember sitting in my
apartment,

128
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,801
at a window seat on
the third floor

129
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,678
looking down, and I
really really considered

130
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,097
jumping out the window that
night.

131
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,932
I remember
that night vividly.

132
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,601
I have had issues with
depression

133
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
and cutting from when I was a
freshman in

134
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,982
high school up until my
freshman year of college.

135
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,859
I first started struggling with
depression

136
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,237
when I was about
10 or 11 years old.

137
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,826
I brought that with me into
college where things got worse

138
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,371
because, you know, I was
separated from my family,

139
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:59,627
my academic standards became...

140
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,132
sort of... just a cloud,
constantly hanging over me.

141
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:09,595
It got to the point where I was
cutting pretty much every day.

142
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,639
In her book "The Bell Jar",

143
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,518
Sylvia Plath talks about the
idea that

144
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:21,149
depression and mental health
issues can act like a bell jar

145
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:27,238
in which, it can descend at any
moment and you're trapped.

146
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:32,160
There's the world outside, and
there's you inside and

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,413
everything is distorted,
everything is suffocating and...

148
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,874
and I'm still trying to work
through that.

149
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,295
I was in middle school, so I
didn't really realize that

150
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,131
I could have killed myself
accidentally with cutting.

151
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,759
I never really thought about it,

152
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,430
I just liked the pain and the
release.

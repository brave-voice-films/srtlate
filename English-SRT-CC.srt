1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,221
Josh communicated but

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,850
it's also the belief that

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,768
we never knew the severity

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,272
nor I don't think he knew how to
communicate the severity of it.

5
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,623
I had a pretty happy childhood

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,543
You know, I had trouble fitting
in but nothing outside the norm.

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,172
The night before ninth grade
started, I broke down crying.

8
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,258
I struggled a lot with these
feelings that

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,926
I didn't know what to do with.

10
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,762
I was sad, I had no energy.

11
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,848
I eventually was diagnosed with
depression.

12
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,600
I started hurting myself.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,144
I cut and did other forms of
self-harm

14
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,562
and I thought about suicide.

15
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,940
When I was 12, I started
feeling depressed.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,279
I was sitting in the car on
my way to a girl scout event

17
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,490
and someone mentioned a book

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,036
about a girl who
had committed suicide,

19
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,539
and I think that's the moment
that I realized that,

20
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,584
that's what I wanted to do.

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,755
There was a magazine in a
doctor's office,

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:34,010
that had an article about
kids having cutting groups

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,888
and going to the
bathroom and cutting

24
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:43,311
and I thought, I could try this
and it just became an addiction

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,106
because when I was nervous or
anxious or depressed or angry

26
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,608
that's what I would go to.

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,153
In my past, I've had experience
with eating disorders,

28
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,947
suicide, and self-harm.

29
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,243
As far as eating disorders
go, there was a time when I

30
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,955
deliberately withheld food from
myself in order to lose weight.

31
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,291
Self-harm, for about a year
and half straight I would

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
wake up in the morning with
a knife under my pillow

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,174
and cut myself on my arm
and my inner leg.

34
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,761
There were a couple of
times when I attempted to

35
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,056
commit suicide by cutting
myself and bleeding out.

36
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,476
When I was 13, I began to
struggle with

37
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,562
anorexia and depression

38
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,482
and it continued well into
the age of 17.

39
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,529
When I was 13, nearly 14
I had reached the first stage

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:40,243
of my weight loss plan, which
was to achieve 98 pounds.

41
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,120
I wanted to break 100 pounds

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,539
'cause anything more than that
seemed obese.

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,791
[Sarah] I remember I would
constantly check my weight

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,460
on online
calculators for B. M. I.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,631
to make sure that I was under
16.8 which was considered to be

46
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,049
underweight by all standards

47
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,635
and I thought that was an
accomplishment

48
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,430
so I kept it as close to that
as I could

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,265
and wanted to go even lower.

50
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,269
I had a fantastic childhood,

51
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,771
it's always hard to talk about
this most of the time with

52
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,275
people, or to feel legitimacy in
the struggles that I went

53
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,653
through because I hear a lot of
people who said that they were

54
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,281
abused as children and had
really rough childhoods

55
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,366
but I had... um...

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,203
a great upbringing, supportive
parents, great family life.

57
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,248
There was nothing was nothing in
my life situation

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,709
that should have pointed to the
struggles that I encountered,

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,046
particularly with depression but
it started to become

60
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,131
something that was beyond
my control

61
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,217
by the time that I reached 13
it kind of snuck up on me.

62
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,303
Again a Fairfield Township
family

63
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,930
is struggling for answers
tonight

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
after the untimely death of
their daughter.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,476
Florida authorities believe a 12
year old girl

66
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,477
committed suicide.

67
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,730
A community is mourning the
suicide of a 13 year old

68
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,523
who took his life at school.

69
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,109
Harleydonna McGuire whom
everyone called "Kitty"

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,654
committed suicide last Tuesday.

71
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,614
A mother found her ten year old
daughter

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,907
who had committed suicide.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,203
A new government report showed
an 8% increase in suicides among

74
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,621
children and young adults

75
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,999
and that is the largest rise in
about 15 years.

76
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,418
[Matt]
We see these stories every day.

77
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,838
Depression, anxiety, eating
disorders, self-harm

78
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,383
these are just a few of the
prominent mental illnesses that

79
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,259
teens and young adults face.

80
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,304
For many young people, these
conditions are an unexplained,

81
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,391
confusing, and often paralyzing
part of their lives.

82
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,101
[Sarah] They can grow
 to believe

83
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,477
that this is
their fault.

84
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,854
That this is something
they should be ashamed of.

85
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,816
Sometimes they're too afraid
to reach out for help.

86
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,152
Sometimes they're pressured to
hide this part of them away.

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,155
[Narrator] We started this
project as a small group

88
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,448
of high school and
college students

89
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,200
to tell our own stories and
those of our close

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,785
friends and family.

91
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,580
We have seen first hand how easy
it is to hide behind a mask.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,582
We wanted to start a
conversation.

93
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,376
We put out a call asking for
teens to share

94
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,169
their experiences with us

95
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,672
and were amazed at the
response we received.

96
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,633
Our crew expanded shooting
hundreds of hours of footage.

97
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,218
We saw the effect the stigmas
had on the

98
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,095
lives of countless
teens.

99
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,097
These are the stories we wanted
to tell.

100
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,565
I was in my mid-twenties,

101
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,819
I had a good job, I was you
know... I kind of...

102
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,988
I called it my mask life.
Everyone on the outside

103
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,281
would think I was doing fine.

104
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,033
I had a good job, I had a lot of
friends,

105
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,701
I was involved in things

106
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,536
on the inside I was miserable,

107
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,247
and I really didn't share that
with anybody

108
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,459
because I didn't trust
anybody enough to do that.

109
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,045
I was content in my life,
there was no reason why

110
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,546
I would
be unhappy.

111
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,592
But there were these symptoms
that started to kind of overtake

112
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,177
the way that I viewed myself,

113
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,679
and also my future, and it was
uncharacteristic

114
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,558
because I always was, and have
tried to be a very happy person,

115
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,269
very positive and optimistic and
that's what people knew me as.

116
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,980
So when I started to feel off,

117
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,609
I didn't know how to
explain it to anyone

118
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,360
I didn't know how to understand
it myself

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,780
so I just didn't talk
about it

120
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,199
and that was when I was 13.

121
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,241
When I was depressed,

122
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:11,079
I think my self-esteem got worse
cause everyone

123
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,580
was telling me that I should
have been okay,

124
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,665
and I was trying to be

125
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,335
and I couldn't be and I felt
like a failure

126
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,712
in that I couldn't do anything
right.

127
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,507
And I remember sitting in my
apartment,

128
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,801
at a window seat on
the third floor

129
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,678
looking down, and I
really really considered

130
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,097
jumping out the window that
night.

131
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,932
I remember
that night vividly.

132
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,601
I have had issues with
depression

133
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
and cutting from when I was a
freshman in

134
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,982
high school up until my
freshman year of college.

135
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,859
I first started struggling with
depression

136
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,237
when I was about
10 or 11 years old.

137
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,826
I brought that with me into
college where things got worse

138
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,371
because, you know, I was
separated from my family,

139
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:59,627
my academic standards became...

140
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,132
sort of... just a cloud,
constantly hanging over me.

141
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:09,595
It got to the point where I was
cutting pretty much every day.

142
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,639
In her book "The Bell Jar",

143
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,518
Sylvia Plath talks about the
idea that

144
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:21,149
depression and mental health
issues can act like a bell jar

145
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:27,238
in which, it can descend at any
moment and you're trapped.

146
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:32,160
There's the world outside, and
there's you inside and

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,413
everything is distorted,
everything is suffocating and...

148
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,874
and I'm still trying to work
through that.

149
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,295
I was in middle school, so I
didn't really realize that

150
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,131
I could have killed myself
accidentally with cutting.

151
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,759
I never really thought about it,

152
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,430
I just liked the pain and the
release.

153
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,182
[Laurel] I was talking to a
girl 'til two...

154
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,350
three in the morning
who was cutting that night

155
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,438
and I just said "How do you know
that the cuts that you make

156
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,691
might not be the one that takes
your life?"

157
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,319
You know, I mean she wasn't in a
suicidal mode that night.

158
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,198
She was just trying to release
some pain.

159
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,617
And I said "How do you know?
How do you cross that line,

160
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,327
or know that you're not
going to cross that line?"

161
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,622
And the fear was so real,
she was just like

162
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,165
"I don't want to kill myself
tonight,"

163
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,001
"I just want the pain to stop
and go away."

164
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,170
and you know, your heart aches
for that

165
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,255
because it is a real fear.

166
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,507
They know that, there's no
parent

167
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,092
is going to be really excited to
say

168
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,011
"Oh terrific" you know, yeah.

169
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,180
There's the fear of the
reaction.

170
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,933
Are they gonna scream?
Are they gonna cry?

171
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,935
Are they gonna care at all?

172
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,479
I think that's a 
really valid fear

173
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,689
for some of these kids
who feel that no one cares.

174
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,484
They would see the evidence

175
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,736
They would see that
I was upset

176
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,906
and that, you know,
I wasn't doing well

177
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,866
and they would make
comments like

178
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,201
"You know, you seem really
out of it.

179
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,786
are you sure nothing's wrong?"

180
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,413
and I would make it obvious
that I wasn't okay

181
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,749
but they never followed up.

182
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:07,088
They never... they never
really checked on me.

183
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,631
And then they would see a scar

184
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,633
and they would ask where it
came from and

185
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,636
I wouldn't really answer them
and they would just let it go.

186
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,847
And they would notice that I
wasn't eating and they'd be like

187
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,140
"Have you eaten? Have you
eaten?"

188
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,184
and I'd be like "No, I'll get
there.

189
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,146
I'll eat eventually" and they...

190
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,692
they knew, they just didn't do
anything.

191
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,695
There are clear cut, clear cut

192
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,447
definite situations where a
parent...

193
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,533
parent's lack of
care and concern

194
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,034
would definitely
cross that line.

195
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,661
Especially if, God forbid,

196
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,913
the child ended up
taking their own life.

197
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,917
Ignoring suicide
threats or self-abuse

198
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,169
can be seen as a form of neglect

199
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,089
but I think it becomes
situational.

200
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,051
There are some kids that go to
such extreme lengths to hide,

201
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,678
especially self-abuse,

202
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,098
that the parent
really isn't aware.

203
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,891
The best thing that we can
possibly do

204
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,019
is to help them find
ways to cope

205
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,397
where they are, in the
situation they're in

206
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,942
and for some it's two,
three, four, five years

207
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,570
that they have to go through
until they can walk out the door

208
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,072
and make a life.

209
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,824
There's nothing better than
seeing a kid

210
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,784
that has done that,
that has made it.

211
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,162
You know? And that has said

212
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,581
"I chose this path and I'm
really, really glad."

213
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,708
For the early part of fall,

214
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,252
I knew nothing of
Annie's condition.

215
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,630
In November, on finding her
blog, I was thrown into a world

216
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,382
that affects me even today.

217
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,218
Posts showing graphic images
of self-harm

218
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,970
composed almost all of it.

219
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,639
[Anonymous friend]
I remember being horrified

220
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,183
that I could be
so ignorant

221
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,602
of so much pain being
so near to me.

222
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,147
What really strikes me
in the community

223
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,274
that I'm involved with is

224
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:55,529
just how much kids are trying
desperately to save the lives

225
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,615
and be there for their friends.

226
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,242
My parents still, they didn't
understand

227
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,204
and I'm not sure if
they were trying

228
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,539
or if they just didn't want to,

229
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,292
but I needed the help
that I wasn't getting.

230
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,003
I was introduced to Annie
through a mutual friend,

231
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:16,384
they asked if I could act sort
of as a lifeline for Annie.

232
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:22,306
For an extended period of time,
literally months,

233
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:28,062
we would be up until 2 or 3 a.m.
sometimes on a given night

234
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:32,441
talking with Annie, and you know
trying to talk her down and

235
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,112
we didn't know if she was
going to, you know,

236
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,407
we didn't know if that next
message would ever come in.

237
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:44,954
We were terrified that she
could literally, you know,

238
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:51,460
make a decision to end her life
mid-conversation

239
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,964
and we were afraid that
we were helpless.

240
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,341
I wasn't anywhere near
ready to take on

241
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,926
such an emotionally, mentally,

242
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,554
and even physically
demanding role.

243
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,847
Being a support system

244
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,683
took me straight past my limits
as a 15 year old.

245
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,227
I know a couple of kids that
have been there for others,

246
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,356
and one of the things
I am also stressing to them,

247
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,900
and I think this is
so important:

248
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,986
Yes, it's important to
love the person,

249
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,280
and yes it's important...
they need that.

250
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,865
They need to know that
somebody's there.

251
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,992
They've got my back. They're
gonna never leave me.

252
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,827
They're gonna always love me.

253
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,829
But that person needs to set
boundaries

254
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,081
and take care of
themselves as well.

255
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,252
The stress and accountability
was almost unbearable.

256
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,046
It got to the point where
I was terrified to sleep

257
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,633
and terrified that on waking
I'd find out that she dead

258
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,178
and all because I hadn't stayed
up to talk to her.

259
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,264
I had no experience, no
training,

260
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,099
no reference to go by.

261
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,393
Yes, you need to be there

262
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,312
but you also need to
take care of yourself

263
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,858
because you can't be that friend
if it's all give, give, give,

264
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,527
give and you're not getting
anything back for yourself.

265
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,405
Someone had told my mom

266
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,533
that they thought that
I was just looking for attention

267
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,828
and that what I was going
through wasn't real.

268
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,207
If there someone who is looking
for attention,

269
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
there's obviously a reason for
that,

270
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,045
and just going through
depression,

271
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,172
it's not for attention, it's...

272
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,133
You can't do anything about it,
it's just there.

273
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,303
In Annie's case, she was
obviously in need

274
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,139
far before she
received professional help.

275
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,016
But between family strains

276
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,143
and receiving devoted
non-professional help

277
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,562
it doesn't surprise me that she
only received help

278
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,648
when the matter was unavoidable.

279
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,942
I think my parents felt that

280
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,486
they didn't want anything to be
wrong with me

281
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,323
so that they didn't raise a
child who was messed up.

282
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,283
They just... They didn't want to
accept

283
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,077
the fact that I wasn't okay.

284
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,703
[Annie] A friend of mine
called the cops,

285
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,373
around the time that I was 14

286
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:58,546
because I had told him that I
was going to kill myself

287
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,882
and when the cops showed up,

288
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,468
I told them that nothing
was wrong,

289
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,430
and my parents told them that
nothing was wrong.

290
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,517
It just felt like no one wanted
to deal with what was going on.

291
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,894
The first night of 2011,

292
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,688
I stayed up very late
into the night,

293
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,899
talking to a friend about Annie,
which was only to set the theme

294
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,402
for the next months to come.

295
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
Nearly every night would find me

296
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,114
either talking to her
desperately

297
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,074
or talking to another friend,

298
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,076
completely at a loss for
what to do.

299
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,621
The worst part was our seeming
utter lack of progress.

300
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,498
I would go to bed one night,

301
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
somewhat assured that my long
conversation with her

302
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,586
had made some impact,

303
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,214
yet the next night she would
be as bad as ever.

304
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,176
She needed us.
That much was clear.

305
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,429
She had a date.

306
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,766
The seventh, because 
seven is a good number.

307
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,185
I remember asking a friend
what that even meant,

308
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,564
yet not even pausing for an
answer.

309
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:03,027
She had a place,
the creek by her house.

310
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,738
The rawness of how concrete
her intentions were

311
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,656
almost destroyed me.

312
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,325
After dealing with weeks of

313
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,620
"I'm going to kill myself"
here she was,

314
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,581
and she was ready despite
everything we gave.

315
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,915
...and everyone was frantic,

316
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:20,878
you could tell that these people
loved this person so much.

317
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,755
So I hopped in my car and
I drove to the hospital,

318
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,714
and it's like, I had no idea if

319
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,341
the parents were even going to
let her see me,

320
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,217
or if the parents would
let me in, but I was like

321
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,512
"I have to go, and find out what
I can."

322
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,974
Just to let the network of
support know what's going on,

323
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,102
because there were so many
that were there that cared.

324
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,272
[Annie] When I was at the
emergency room,

325
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:46,570
I had two different doctors come
in and ask me questions and

326
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,364
I... I was still scared,

327
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
I didn't want to tell them
the date.

328
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,036
I didn't want them to know it
was something that,

329
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,331
I felt maybe I could still get
away with I guess?

330
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:04,421
And after a little while they
told me and my mom

331
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,050
that I would have to be
hospitalized.

332
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,804
I've had that person tell me
what that visit meant.

333
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,722
You know, I was only there for
about five minutes.

334
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,765
Both parents were there

335
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,393
so it was very, very awkward.
Um.

336
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,520
And that we couldn't
really talk at all.

337
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,355
But that person has 
repeatedly told me

338
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,066
that just having me
show up that night

339
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,152
and know that all those
people were asking,

340
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,487
it made a huge difference.

341
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,239
And I think that's really what
it amounts to,

342
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,408
it's having that
support network that

343
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,702
if your family can't give
it to you,

344
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,495
then you find the family that
can.

345
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:41,041
I know a lot of people in
my life struggle with depression

346
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,751
and anxiety and self-harm,

347
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,048
and all of those situations are
different,

348
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,427
but a lot of times I feel like

349
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,430
they aren't supported by
their families.

350
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,598
I don't really think I would
have wanted

351
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,100
my parents in particular
involved.

352
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,940
I think my parents were kind of
emotionally in-equipped to help.

353
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,819
Somebody, maybe other parents
I knew,

354
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,239
were probably more helpful and
influential than my own,

355
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,742
I think at times, but no I
don't think

356
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,660
having my parents involved would
have helped.

357
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,916
One night, I was on the verge
of attempting suicide

358
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:27,880
and somebody knew about it
and called my parents.

359
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,174
My parents didn't come in
and check on me,

360
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,676
they didn't say anything,

361
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,469
they didn't...

362
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,055
they didn't even say anything
the next day, like...

363
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,974
They didn't do anything.

364
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,726
Even when all of those things
were brought

365
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,311
directly to 
their attention.

366
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:52,529
The lowest point that I have
ever reached in my life was when

367
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,492
I was sitting right at
this kitchen table actually,

368
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,412
many of the people who I had
invested in, in the past,

369
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:08,003
who I had identified myself
as a savior figure unhealthily,

370
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,757
their situations began to take
a downward spiral

371
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,718
and there was nothing
that I could do to help them,

372
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,805
and by some twist of fate,
it all happened at once.

373
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:24,019
I remember sitting here being
so unable to come to terms

374
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,313
with the fact that I needed
to move on

375
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,649
and I needed
to find something

376
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,734
else to focus on because
that's what I had told

377
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,277
so many other people

378
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,196
when I was counseling
them as a friend,

379
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,031
that when they had reached
this point,

380
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,992
you just have to focus
on the positive.

381
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,328
And that hit home
especially hard because

382
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,956
I was the one who was supposed
to be the positive figure.

383
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,792
So when I couldn't
do that myself,

384
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,044
it was the scariest feeling.

385
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,840
[Sarah]
I remember sitting here,

386
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,677
allowing all of these things to
consume me,

387
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:03,934
and I felt so drowned by them.
I thought that this was some

388
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,937
sign from the universe that
my purpose was done here.

389
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,483
If I removed myself from the
world,

390
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:17,573
that it would be a greater gain
than if I was here.

391
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:22,160
So I went into the other room
and I got out the painkillers,

392
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,288
and I had done my research,
at that point.

393
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,583
I laid out the exact amount
that I needed.

394
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,880
And I remember staring at them
feeling like...

395
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,050
Feeling this very odd,
unnerving, sense of peace.

396
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,805
That this was again, necessary
for what needed to happen.

397
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,349
Then I went into the kitchen,
and I got a glass of water,

398
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,351
and I set it down, and I
stared at all of it

399
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,561
in front of me,

400
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:55,527
and got a burst of what some
people may call courage,

401
00:19:55,527 --> 00:20:00,115
and I grabbed on to the first
round of them and

402
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,533
I don't know how
to describe it,

403
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,620
but I was hit with
this feeling of

404
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,999
"Oh my gosh,
what am I doing?"

405
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,419
It was this odd
wave of blankness

406
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,755
in my mind and I
dropped the pills,

407
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,174
I dropped my water
and I just...

408
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:27,184
I realized at that point that I
needed to finally ask for help

409
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:31,021
because I never reached
a point that low before

410
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,023
and I had never imagined that

411
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,316
the things that I
considered to be

412
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:40,113
so necessary for my perfection
and my worth...

413
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,616
They could lead me to such
a dark place.

414
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,952
I think my parents did
want the best for me.

415
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,912
I think they did
want me to recover.

416
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,414
But they didn't know what to do.

417
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,499
And they didn't want to believe

418
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,709
it was as much of
an issue as it was.

419
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,920
I think one of the reasons I
never asked for help

420
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,631
was just... shame.

421
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,385
I didn't feel like I
should need help

422
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,388
to deal with those
kinds of issues and

423
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,182
I didn't... I didn't really want
to involve anyone

424
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,350
other than myself.

425
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,852
I never told my parents
about this

426
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,022
until after I could come to
terms with it myself.

427
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,608
I wanted to be able to have
it all together

428
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,069
in a responsible-sounding
package

429
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,697
before I could discuss it
with them because

430
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,658
to me I was afraid that they
would see it as weakness

431
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,245
and I wanted their trust
because for so long

432
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,454
I had been their confidant.

433
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,749
So, in my mind, the only
way to maintain that

434
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,293
was just keeping it a secret
until I could fix it myself.

435
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,838
One afternoon I was walking to
the school bus

436
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,923
and I had a voicemail
from my dad,

437
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,801
just saying how much he loved me
and cared about me

438
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,846
and when I got home, my mom sat
me down and told me that the

439
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,682
guidance counselor told her I'd
been having a rough time,

440
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,518
and was taking it out in some
pretty self-destructive ways.

441
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,188
At first they handled it by
trying to talk to me.

442
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,942
But I didn't stop right away
and so they tried to punish me.

443
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,403
Threatening to take away things
like time with friends,

444
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,488
or activities that I wanted to
do

445
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,198
if I didn't stop hurting myself.

446
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,993
I think that generally when a
parent

447
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,706
finds out that their child is
suffering from depression or

448
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:17,210
self-harming, they...

449
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,546
they like to think that it's
just a phase,

450
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:24,259
that it's not a real issue, that
it's something that they can

451
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,261
ignore because they don't want
to face it.

452
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,222
Nobody wants to face that their
child is

453
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,058
unhappy and hurting themselves.

454
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,727
But it happens,

455
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,105
and it happens a lot more than
we would like to admit.

456
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,733
They punished me by saying
"You can't go to summer camp."

457
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,026
"You can't go to the concert.

458
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,277
You can't hang out with your
friends."

459
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,653
I think they thought it was
something

460
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,739
they could just treat like that.

461
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,824
I don't think they understood

462
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,619
how big the issue was, or what
the issue was.

463
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,579
The issue wasn't that I was
hurting myself.

464
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,748
The issue was that I was so
upset and so depressed

465
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,500
that I restored to hurting
myself,

466
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,460
because I didn't feel like I
could talk to anyone.

467
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,254
You know, when a kid is
depressed you have to wonder why

468
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,091
a parent just doesn't seem to
see it.

469
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926
So you wonder like "Why?"

470
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,555
Why do the parent's just not
address it.

471
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,142
I think in some cases it really
truly is a case of ignorance.

472
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,520
They really truly may not see
it.

473
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,065
They're just living on a
superficial level and they don't

474
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,485
process what they're seeing as
what it really is.

475
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:28,740
There are times where I find a
student that

476
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,661
the issues have been brought to
their parents attention.

477
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:37,541
The parents are refusing help,
appropriate help,

478
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,668
through normal channels 
of say therapy

479
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:46,091
and counseling, and it's always
difficult

480
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,969
because you can't push too much
with a parent that's resistant.

481
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,762
But there are some parents that
really do know.

482
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,723
Their child has been pretty
upfront

483
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,227
that I really, really need
help.

484
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,522
And they're not doing anything,
or they're giving it the

485
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:05,485
lightest treatment or "It'll
blow over" kind of an attitude.

486
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,488
Then it's getting really close
that line I think of

487
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,866
I don't know if I would call it
abuse but definitely neglect.

488
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:15,996
A kid who is, you know, 14, 15
years old who is screaming out

489
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,999
for "I need treatment, I need...
I need antidepressants,

490
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,377
I need something." and their
parent's aren't just saying

491
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,630
"It'll pass, it'll pass."

492
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,967
You know, what's going to happen
to that parent if that child

493
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,385
doesn't get the help
they need and they

494
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:34,139
finally take their own life. I
think of it that way, it's like

495
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,017
then okay, were you responsible
for your child's death?

496
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,102
This isn't talking about the
parents who are just

497
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,730
haven't noticed or... This is
talking about the people that

498
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,399
the kids have come to them or an
educator or someone has come

499
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,735
to them and said "This is what's
going on and it's..."

500
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,237
"You know, there needs to be
something done."

501
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,490
I think a lot of parents take it
personally.

502
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,076
They might take it as an insult
on their...

503
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,412
their own parenting skills.

504
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,874
They might be afraid, again in
previous generations

505
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,959
mental-illness was not
discussed.

506
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:07,005
It was a matter of shame,
something to be hidden.

507
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,759
And it's really important, I
think, right now to change

508
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,053
that attitude in today's
parents.

509
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,555
To understand that you would
treat a mental illness

510
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,932
the same way you would
treat another illness.

511
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,225
You wouldn't keep
a diabetic home

512
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,393
and not give them insulin
because you're embarrased.

513
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,772
I think there are also a lot of
parents that are

514
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:28,068
afraid to admit their kid has a
real problem

515
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,320
and is that going to reflect on
my parenting skills,

516
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,657
and the image of what are
people going think if I tell

517
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,742
people my kid is self-harming.
Are they gonna think

518
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,536
that I'm a bad parent? So it's
easier just to ignore it.

519
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,789
Maybe it'll go away, maybe
they'll get over it.

520
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,959
It's okay to be honest, it's
okay to talk about this stuff.

521
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,461
If you struggle, if you struggle
with depression or addiction

522
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,047
it shouldn't be any different
than a broken arm,

523
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,634
or the flu, or even cancer. You
know, those are things that

524
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,678
if you were sick in that way or
you broke a bone

525
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,389
you wouldn't try to hide it, you
wouldn't try to play it off.

526
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,975
And we... And yet when it comes
to mental health so many people

527
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,185
do try to hide it, and so many
people feel like they

528
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,981
can't talk about it, and we want
to be about seeing that change.

529
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,816
I'm always trying to get the
kids to look at it from

530
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,402
the parent's point of view as
well.

531
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:15,699
Only in that they have to
understand that

532
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,159
the parent's might be doing the
best that they can do.

533
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,953
They don't know what kind of
baggage their parents have

534
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,747
brought into the situation.
Were they abused as kids?

535
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,708
Did they have alcoholism
involved?

536
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,711
There's always another story
that they might not be

537
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,170
taking the time to see.

538
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,465
I think a lot of times we have a
problem with things

539
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,218
that we don't understand. And
so that's outside

540
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,097
our comfort zone and we tend to
avoid it or we tend not to

541
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,475
go there, and I'm not a parent
but I can imagine that as a

542
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,812
parent it's a difficult thing to
be honest about the fact

543
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,773
that your son or daughter is
struggling, and maybe they

544
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,859
feel like that's a reflection on
them.

545
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:56,031
I think sometimes it's easier to
sidestep it,

546
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,825
pretend you don't see it. You
know, yeah he's a teenager

547
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,870
he's just got a bad attitude.
It's not about being a teenager

548
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,080
and having a bad attitude, it's
about being a teenager

549
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,833
and you being his mom or dad,
and you need to pay attention

550
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,085
to know what's going on in your
house.

551
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,338
We buy into the idea that our
friends, our family,

552
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,131
they're busy, they have problems
of their own.

553
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,883
They have enough on their plate.

554
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,177
And as a result I think
sometimes we think we're

555
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,804
supposed to just get through our
stuff on our own.

556
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,266
You know we're supposed to
toughen up or suck it up

557
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,895
and there's a lot of lies that I
think make up that stigma.

558
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,522
I know in the black community,
getting help for mental health

559
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,150
isn't really something that is
done.

560
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,194
When I was a senior in high
school I went to see a...

561
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,654
a psychologist, because I was
stressed and anxious

562
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:41,117
and depressed. Instead of going
to therapy

563
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
my mother had suggested, you
know like,

564
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,330
"I think that you can deal with
this on your own,

565
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,541
I think you'll be fine without
therapy, without drugs" and

566
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,211
Looking back now, I wish I had
gone to therapy

567
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,837
instead of trying to deal with
it on my own

568
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,464
and struggling with it for so
long.

569
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,674
If you were afraid to talk to
your parents you were supposed

570
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,094
to speak to a teacher or a
guidance counselor

571
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,806
that you trusted, which I did in
a very round about way.

572
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,265
I just said "You know, I'm
having some trouble

573
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,935
with these mood swings. I'm not
sure what to do."

574
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,647
One way or another it got back
to my parents and they were

575
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,483
less than supportive. They
thought that I was being

576
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,445
overdramatic and that I was
vying for attention and that

577
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,573
all I needed to do was "Get my
head on straight, work harder."

578
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,492
and uh.... So I...

579
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,579
When I had a chance to get help,
I kind of caved

580
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,040
and said "You're right, I'm
sorry, I don't mean

581
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,669
to cause trouble. I'll shut up
now." It was a mistake.

582
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,674
It's a parent's primary
responsibility to protect

583
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,802
their child.

584
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,638
If they have even an inkling
that there might be

585
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,142
something wrong, I would suggest
that you err

586
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,519
on the side of caution.

587
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,565
Please get help. If it turns out
it's nothing, well thank God,

588
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,276
and if it turns out it's
something then

589
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,528
you may have just saved that
kid's life.

590
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,321
Everyone knows somebody that's
taken their life,

591
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,366
there's no question and I
remember in college

592
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,702
I remember getting the news that
somebody had taken their life,

593
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,539
and it was somebody I never
would have expected

594
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,499
would kill themselves.

595
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,294
And so, again it gets back to
that whole mask, you know.

596
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,089
Like you can appear like
everything's fine

597
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,343
and inside you're just dying. So
you know, you just have to...

598
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,804
You have to meet people where
they are, but if there are

599
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,349
visible signs, you just, you
have to...

600
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,810
I'm amazed at the people that
can just turn away,

601
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,147
and say, you know, "I don't want
to get involved."

602
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,440
Maybe they're afraid to get
involved?

603
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,983
Maybe they're afraid they don't
know how to deal with it?

604
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:37,567
I don't know.

605
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:43,448
-[Jim] Suicide, as
anyone grew up I mean...

606
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,241
-[Laurette] You didn't
talk about it.

607
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,244
-[Jim] You didn't talk about it.
You were to be, that was a...

608
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,623
-[Laurette] It's a big secret.

609
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,959
-[Jim] That was a....

610
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,587
It was an embarrassment to the
family if you lost somebody

611
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,674
due to suicide. It was a... you
were a coward if you

612
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,053
committed suicide. Those are all
the things I remember

613
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,262
um, about suicide.

614
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,307
I remember back in school, and I
went to a huge high school,

615
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,644
one kid in the four years I was
there committed suicide.

616
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,855
It was not something that... and
we were stunned

617
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,816
because no one did that.

618
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:22,737
So I think, that is part of it.
Suicide has become

619
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,533
much more culturally 
accepted in teens as

620
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,619
almost the final coping
strategy,

621
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,329
or lack of being able to cope.

622
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,917
I remember for the next week
after she had committed suicide,

623
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,418
I just kind of walked around in
a fog.

624
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,255
I remember writing a poem about
it, and you know

625
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,924
the empty chair in the room and
the dust, and like...

626
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,344
What happened?
Where did that girl go?

627
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,473
And I remember at graduation a
couple years later,

628
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,642
she would have been sitting next
to me alphabetically,

629
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,435
we were in the same major.

630
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,729
And I remember when they called
the name

631
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:01,234
of the person that was right
before me I was thinking

632
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,569
she should be next.

633
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,863
She should be walking up to get
her diploma right now.

634
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,950
For a long time I felt like
there was something

635
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,121
not right with my body and
everyone would say

636
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,039
"Oh you're fine, you're just
feeling a little sad," or

637
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,708
"Oh your problems aren't that
real like you just have to

638
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,460
get over it or just don't think
about it too much."

639
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,297
and it was when I came to
college that I actually

640
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,756
finally did something about it.

641
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,925
And I wish I had done something
about it earlier, at least like

642
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,261
seek the help that I knew I
needed.

643
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,346
Maybe it starts with being
honest with a friend or

644
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,725
a family member and we end up
sounding like a broken record.

645
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,852
[Jamie]Encouraging people
to talk to a counselor

646
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,270
to step into treatment.

647
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,273
To take that next step in the
direction of professional help.

648
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,317
I think the biggest challenge is
the stigma because

649
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,527
we've learned that it's
something

650
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,988
people are afraid to talk about,
and so I think that's

651
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,700
the biggest thing we're up
against is that idea

652
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,368
that people buy into
where they say

653
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,829
"Oh, this is something
I can't say out loud.

654
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,248
This is a part of my story
that no one should know.

655
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,959
This is a question I've never
asked." This is...

656
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,837
This is... something that goes
far beyond the status update

657
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,797
and the pictures that we...
we post.

658
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,383
You know, kind of the...
the stories that we're
comfortable with

659
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,177
in terms of our own lives.

660
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,305
-Laurette I think that kids feel
that they have to keep

661
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,059
it a secret because...
Um...

662
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,771
"Oh my God, somebody's going to
find out that... I have all this

663
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,440
stuff going on in my head and I
don't know what to do with it.

664
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,484
You know, what are they
gonna think of me?

665
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,486
What are my friends gonna
think of me?"

666
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,113
I think in some cases,
Josh was that guy.

667
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,948
Um...

668
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,326
He was... a star football
player.

669
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:37,455
I mean, he was um...
a really good looking kid.

670
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,791
He had many, many friends.

671
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,543
None of my friends knew during
the time of my

672
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,463
depression and
anorexia of

673
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,299
anything that I 
was struggling with.

674
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,302
I didn't let them. I didn't let
them into my world

675
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,304
to really
know what was

676
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,099
honestly and truly going on with
me because I was afraid

677
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,975
of what they would think of me.

678
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:01,396
I was helping many people
who were struggling

679
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,191
with similar things and I didn't
want them to know that I was

680
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:09,153
dealing with the same issues
because I thought that would

681
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,823
discount my desire to be there
for them.

682
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:16,661
There was no...
that I knew of... counseling.

683
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,996
There was no hotline that I
could call. Um...

684
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:22,166
Other than seeing what was
derogatorily

685
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,835
referred to as a shrink.

686
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,546
So far as I know, there was no
such thing as a support system.

687
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,216
Maybe it existed, um...
But I didn't have access to it.

688
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,927
They want the pain to end,
but they don't...

689
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,846
They're afraid to
find other alternatives.

690
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,099
I think that's why suicide
is so rampant is that

691
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,269
they desperately, desperately
want the pain to end

692
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,022
but they don't know to find
other ways to make that happen.

693
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:47,316
Or they feel trapped
before that can happen.

694
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:51,279
And so it's just an alternative
that...

695
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,989
They feel like it's the
only answer.

696
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
I was just too intimated.

697
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,492
I felt like I was the only
person in the world

698
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,120
who was ever having
this kind of trouble and um...

699
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,122
I didn't want embarrass my
parents.

700
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,499
I didn't want to put anyone out.
You know, I'm a...

701
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:09,172
I come from a large family um...
so anyone causing trouble for...

702
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,048
You know, causing trouble for
one of us obviously

703
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,842
causes trouble
for the whole family.

704
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,721
So um.. I wish that I had...
had the courage to stand up for

705
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,598
myself and say "You know, 
Yes. I need help.

706
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,267
Please take me to a doctor."
But I didn't then.

707
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,895
The statistic that really
has stayed with me over

708
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,647
the years was the one that said
that two out of three people

709
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,941
who struggle with depression
never get help for it.

710
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,736
That most people who need help
never even take that first step.

711
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,905
Most people never put 
a hand up and say

712
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,365
"Hey, I'm not doing well, 
I need help."

713
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,367
And so I think we've come to
believe that

714
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,245
so many people struggle alone.
So many people feel alone 

715
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,081
when it comes to their 
pain or their questions.

716
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,957
And uh...

717
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,335
And so I think we've had the
amazing opportunity to just

718
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,171
invite people to be honest, 
maybe for the first time.

719
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,133
I didn't ask my parents for help
when I was struggling because

720
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,221
I felt like a burden.
I didn't...

721
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,516
I didn't want to be a problem
for them.

722
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,520
Or an additional problem for
them.

723
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,900
I wanted to be...
a perfect daughter.

724
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,530
When I was 14, I began to
develop of

725
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,658
just controlling tinier things.
Um..

726
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,537
It began with my weight. Uh..

727
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,833
This idea of becoming the
perfect version of myself,

728
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,086
overtook the way that I was
viewing my prospects before.

729
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,964
[Sarah] Before it was simple,
before it was just having

730
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,924
friends, engaging in thee people
that I knew.

731
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:41,222
Embracing my family and
somehow this obsession kind of

732
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:48,104
overtook all of those priorities
and soon all that I cared about

733
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,314
was how much I weighed.

734
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,651
You know, I think there is a
tremendous stigma, and I think

735
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,946
there's shame and confusion that
kinda hovers over this

736
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,366
conversation and just keeps it
quiet. Keeps it from happening.

737
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,119
And I think we're afraid of
being labeled, we're afraid

738
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,580
of being judged, we're afraid of
being misunderstood.

739
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,709
Most mental illnesses don't
resolve themselves.

740
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,586
It's not a phase.

741
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:16,465
It's not a bid for attention,
it's not a growing pain.

742
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,595
People need help.

743
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,181
And ignoring a problem doesn't
make it go away,

744
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,724
it makes it much, much worse.

745
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:30,980
So many people are into
presenting that false, phoney

746
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,815
"Oh yes, we're wonderful, we're
happy,

747
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,941
we do all the right things.

748
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,234
Look at our glorious children
and their

749
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,195
matching outfits and
how wonderful."

750
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,907
It's a bunch of crap.
I mean, it is.

751
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,199
I think a lot of times as
people,

752
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,201
we're afraid of what we don't
understand.

753
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:48,456
And so we do hear those stories
of young people who don't get

754
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,000
the care that they need and
deserve because

755
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,294
the parents are afraid, or the
parents in a way sweep it

756
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,464
under the rug and say it's not
a big deal.

757
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,592
Or say you know, no, you don't
need that kind of help.

758
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,136
Maybe they even think it's
a reflection on them.

759
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,389
When I came out as bisexual I
had a lot of support from my

760
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,353
friends and I thought that was
enough, but it turns out that

761
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,315
wasn't enough for me.
I feel like there is...

762
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,652
You need to have other friends
who are sort of like you.

763
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,447
And since I came to college I
have more friends that are gay,

764
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,992
bisexual, lesbian and it makes
me not feel so alone.

765
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:31,499
And I think that is a big part
of depression in LGBT people is

766
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:36,087
that they might not have a lot
of friends that are similar to

767
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,756
them, or they just feel like
they're alone

768
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,092
I mean, you see... and this
might sound stupid

769
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,176
but I think it's
totally valid.

770
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,221
You see your friends going from
relationship to relationship

771
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,932
and they can hold hands with
their boyfriend or girlfriend

772
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,601
because they're heterosexual
and that's totally fine

773
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,895
and I mean, I feel
like

774
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,313
subconsciously you
sort of think

775
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,441
"Well, if I did that, there's
some risk associated with that."

776
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,486
Or you know like, 
it's so much harder

777
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,779
for me to find a
relationship.

778
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,489
Why is it so much harder 
for me? And so much

779
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,118
easier for someone else.
Why is it that if I want a

780
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,036
relationship it's so much more
complicated?

781
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,999
It's really confusing, trying to
figure out who you are.

782
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:19,463
And when who you are can be
condemned by a vast majority of

783
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,591
people around you, that just
makes everything you're going

784
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,678
through so much more difficult.

785
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,888
It makes coping with it that
much harder.

786
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,224
It makes getting help that much
harder because

787
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,937
you're scared to be who you are.
And you're scared to...

788
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,858
You're scared that if you start
unraveling pieces of you

789
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,486
And start showing them to the
world they're gonna condemn you.

790
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,407
Nearly half of transgender
youth have seriously thought

791
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,908
about taking their lives.

792
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,120
One quarter report having
attempted to do so.

793
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,750
Each episode of LGBT
victimization increases the odds

794
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,295
of self-harming behavior
by two and a half times.

795
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,131
In comparison to their straight
peers,

796
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,924
gay, lesbian, and
bisexual youth

797
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,927
are four times more likely to
attempt suicide.

798
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,847
Among these teens, those whose
families reject them are

799
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,934
8.4 times more likely
to attempt suicide.

800
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,520
That means that, compared to
their straight peers,

801
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,231
a teen who is not accepted by
theirvfamily is over 32 times

802
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,734
more likely
to attempt suicide.

803
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,946
I've had friends who've had
problems with

804
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:29,450
depression, self-harm, 
eating disorders

805
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,371
It was actually the way I first
started

806
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,207
making friends in middle
school.

807
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,876
I started hanging out with a
group of girls

808
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,753
and I didn't think anything
different.

809
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:46,008
like they were great girls,
and we had fun hanging out

810
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,845
and one day we were all called
into the guidance office

811
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,139
together and they asked us to
roll up our sleeves and I was

812
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,893
like "I have no idea what's
going on? I don't understand

813
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:00,314
why..." I was like 
"Okay, I'm gonna do this."

814
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,734
And the other girls 
were like, not really,

815
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,488
not really doing
what was asked of them.

816
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,867
One of the girls, after 
the initial like

817
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,955
roll-up your
sleeves fiasco

818
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,624
she um... she came to me
and she she was like

819
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,044
'You know what?
This is what I've been doing

820
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,838
like there's marks on my stomach
too,

821
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,340
like it's the only way I
feel better."

822
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,011
And I was like "Well, you know
what? I'm gonna try to help you

823
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,807
anyway I can but I want you to
know that if I can't do

824
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,184
something for you I'm going to
find someone who will."

825
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,689
We're in the seventh grade and
like I was good at keeping

826
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,858
secrets but I wasn't going to
keep a secret that was

827
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,942
gonna hurt someone.

828
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,404
It's not betraying a friend to
go to an adult.

829
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:53,534
You do not have the tools as a
teenager to be able to handle

830
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,078
something this serious, many
adults don't have the tools.

831
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,956
So go to someone.
Seek out help. 

832
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,333
That's being
the best friend you can be.

833
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,336
After the whole guidance
counselor thing

834
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,256
I always prefaced any kind of
conversation that we had like

835
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,760
that with I want you to know
that I will keep your confidence

836
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,263
but the second I feel like I
can't help you,

837
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,806
I will find someone who can.

838
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:20,394
One of the other ancillary
situations that you deal with a

839
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:25,858
lot with these children that are
struggling is what to

840
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,818
tell or do
with their friends

841
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,863
because their friends love them,
their friends care about them

842
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:36,410
but often times they're not
equipped to handle

843
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,953
a friend that's suicidal.

844
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,498
They don't know what to do with
a friend that's cutting, um.

845
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,752
They can... you know,
they're 13, 14, 15 as well.

846
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,631
I didn't know if what I was
doing was right but

847
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,926
I went to the guidance office
like a week later

848
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,471
and she was pulled from school,
the whole

849
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,599
"You have to be evaluated before
you can come back."

850
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,186
And she called me
later that night and told me

851
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,855
I was a terrible friend and that
she would never speak to me

852
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,149
again, she would never trust me
again.

853
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:13,197
But her mom asked to speak to me
on the phone and

854
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,115
like I didn't know if I was
going to be yelled at?

855
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,909
Like there was that five seconds
of panic where

856
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,954
I was like "Oh no, she's mad at
me and her mom's mad at me

857
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,748
and it's... Is this gonna
be this big thing?"

858
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:27,378
And her mom, her mom thanked me
for being such a good friend

859
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,172
and that really threw me because
I didn't really...

860
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,716
I didn't understand why she
felt she had to hide this from

861
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,427
her mom if her mom
was thanking me

862
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:39,056
and I know I didn't know
the whole situation but

863
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,101
she told me that she was proud
of me for going to the

864
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:48,732
guidance office and talking
to the staff there and

865
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,859
I feel like the
worst part of that was

866
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,654
she never trusted me again,
my friend and

867
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,948
we were never friends
again after that.

868
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,785
[Young Girl]
One in five high school freshmen

869
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,453

will consider suicide this year.

870
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,789
More than any other grade.

871
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,999
Within that class, 
girls are

872
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,376
two and a half times
more like than boys

873
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,253
to attempt to end their life.

874
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,841
The suicide rate among 10-14
year olds has grown more than

875
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,011
50% over the last three decades.

876
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,221
Earlier action is essential.

877
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,975
If we start this conversation at
a younger age in schools

878
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,353
and at home, we can prepare
kids to face these topics

879
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,439
as they are entering high
school.

880
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,943
We can do more, we have to do
more.

881
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,280
I think one of the hardest
things for me

882
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,366
to see in all kids that I
work with is

883
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,994
that there are so many that
are really truly in a sense

884
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,497
trapped in their environment.
Most of the kids that I talk to

885
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,584
can be anywhere between
the ages of 12 and

886
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,838
16, 17 years old and because
they're minors the reality

887
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,133
is they're going to be living in
this home for anywhere between

888
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,510
two to five years before they
can walk out the door and

889
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,096
be an adult
and find their own way.

890
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:06,060
That's really, in the eyes of a
teenager, you know four,

891
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,355
five years is a really,
really long time.

892
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,191
And in the eyes of a depressed
teenager,

893
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,904
it's eons because you just,
you can't see past the pain that

894
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,281
you're in to the fact that
things will get better.

895
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:23,077
As educators we've discussed
what our role is in trying to

896
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,121
improve the homelife of children
that are having issues.

897
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,499
And it becomes a 
very murky situation

898
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,834
because it is really
dependent on each

899
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,755
individual family. There are
some where the people...

900
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,300
The children have gone to such
an extent to hide it,

901
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,346
that just letting the parent
know what's happening

902
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,431
they will be very
proactive, they'll get involved.

903
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,766
They want to try to help.

904
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,976
I had to find the guidance
office on my own,

905
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,854
I didn't know who else to talk
to about it. Nobody...

906
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,315
Nobody knew who to go to.

907
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,902
In some places you have to be 18
before you can get an

908
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,197
antidepressant on your own, or
16 and there's some 14 and

909
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:04,034
15 year olds that the idea of
four more years of where they

910
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,204
are and what they're living
with, that's like a long,

911
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,456
long time when you're really
feeling depressed.

912
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,626
So if they could go someplace,
and get free counseling,

913
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,380
or if they could go some place
and talk to someone,

914
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,174
that would be huge.
The one thing I do say to kids

915
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,718
who I really think are in a
position where they

916
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,596
could take their life, um...

917
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,349
I think back to when I was in
that really dark place

918
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:32,604
and I just, I came close and
there's no way in the world at

919
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:36,150
that point that I could ever
imagine what my life

920
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,277
today would be like,
years and years later.

921
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:43,699
And I think to myself,
what I would have missed

922
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,786
if I had made that decision out
of that painful moment.

923
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,998
I mean, I would have missed out
on how many years

924
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:56,336
of incredible happiness,
of joy, of incredible moments,

925
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,338
of people that have 
touched my life

926
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,966
and it's just, I sometimes think
that when people

927
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:06,221
do commit suicide, is the real
tragedy that they then get to

928
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,099
see what they might have missed.

929
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,268
And that, that's what they live
with, for eternity.

930
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,479
Like, oh my God, this is
what I could have had.

931
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,273
-[Jim] We've had no prior
experience with any kind of

932
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:24,698
depression. No exposure to,
close experience to depression.

933
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,160
So what Josh experienced was
brand spanking new

934
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,497
to us, and uh, you know...

935
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,834
We followed the best advice and
practices we could at the time.

936
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,337
-[Laurette] Started freshman
year of college.

937
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:44,676
Started experiencing what he
explained as panic attacks.

938
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,637
He just kept saying, you know,
it feels like somebody's

939
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:52,935
sitting on my chest,
physical pain, and you know,

940
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,646
wound up in the E.R. a couple
times at school.

941
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,482
He would drive four hours every
weekend and come home

942
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,817
from school,
all of freshman year. 

943
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,695
He was there what?
-[Jim] Semester.

944
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,573
-[Laurette] First semester. He
was at St. Francis in Altoona

945
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:11,286
for one semester and was home
every weekend. Just because it

946
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,163
was difficult for 
him to be there.

947
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,207
When he was finished with his
freshman year,

948
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,959
or his freshman
first semester

949
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,336
We um... looked into 
West Chester

950
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,840
which was not that far away, 
and um...

951
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,718
He was there for five hours.
-[Jim] Mhmm.

952
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:31,098
-[Laurette] We took him down,
unpacked him.

953
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,559
Thought everything
was fine.

954
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,895
Five hours later we got a call
from campus police

955
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,898
that he was
in the hospital.

956
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:45,279
He had taken too many Xanax,
which was what he thought was

957
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,155
going to help him, you know,

958
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:52,578
struggling with the anxiety, and
um...

959
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:57,791
He was in I.C.U. for probably 24
hours. Something like that.

960
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:03,755
So it kind of all started to
unravel, freshman year,

961
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,341
and then from that point we
brought him home

962
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,635
and had him do online courses.

963
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,555
-[Jim] So we got there and
talked to the doctor

964
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,849
and one of the 
comments the doctor

965
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:18,687
made when he came in was
he felt like a failure.

966
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,274
So this was in the 
midst of his stupor and

967
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,817
so when he came out
of it they

968
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,570
actually had a
psychiatrist evaluate him

969
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,741
because he felt the way he did.
And uh, their suggestion

970
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,119
was to take him home for a
couple weeks

971
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,122
and then send him back, well you
can't really do that in college

972
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:42,294
so we took him home, he got 
online schooling, and then we

973
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:47,674
proceeded to look for a
psychologist and a psychiatrist

974
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,011
for him to talk to,
that lasted probably the next

975
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,263
five or six months he was going
once a week.

976
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,973
Josh communicated but

977
00:48:54,973 --> 00:49:04,524
it's also the belief that

978
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,111
we never knew the severity
nor I don't think he knew how to

979
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:12,199
communicate the severity of it.

980
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,493
He would communicate,
he would

981
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,203
at times try
to self-medicate

982
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,207
and every time he came out of
that self-medication I call it

983
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,960
he would talk and...

984
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,963
but he never...

985
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,841
I don't want to say he wanted to
be a burden to anybody but

986
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:33,887
I also don't think he knew
how to fix it.

987
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,973
He didn't, he didn't want to...
he didn't feel comfortable

988
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,767
communicating or he didn't
communicate it

989
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,227
'cause when he did 
communicate it

990
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,105
he couldn't, he couldn't
express it.

991
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:47,150
-[Laurette] Never one time did
Josh ever say

992
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,945
"I don't want to be here."
Not one time.

993
00:49:54,408 --> 00:50:00,539
-[Laurette] He took his life in
the garden that he made for me

994
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:06,169
'cause I think he was comforted
by being there.

995
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:14,469
Josh died February 6th of this
year. Um...

996
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,607
I'll never be the same.
I'll never be the same person.

997
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:35,282
He'll never be the same.

998
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:41,747
It's difficult to function 
most days

999
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,709
and I think someone
that takes...

1000
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,712
is considering
taking their life

1001
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,840
you need to understand
what you're leaving.

1002
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,969
And when you make that kind
of decision

1003
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,556
I know sometimes
I hear people say

1004
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:04,019
"It's like something snapped
in them and they just did it."

1005
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,856
Josh talked to me that night.
He said "Mom, you know

1006
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,900
I've been thinking about it all
all day today." and I was like

1007
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,611
"You know what Josh?
We'll put a plan together.

1008
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,654
We will do something.

1009
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,490
We will go talk to
somebody else.

1010
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,117
We will...we'll do whatever
we gotta do

1011
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:23,371
because we get up,
this family gets up.

1012
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,624
[Laurette] No matter what,
we will get through it.

1013
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,751
We will do what we have to do

1014
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,380
and it doesn't matter.
If you're not good tomorrow

1015
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,884
we'll figure it out.
And as far as I was concerned

1016
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,929
we had it figured out.

1017
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,933
Josh could not

1018
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,604
be the burden that he... He
didn't want to be a burden to us

1019
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,774
and honestly I don't care
who you are.

1020
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:55,445
You're not a burden
to your family ever.

1021
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,614
Ever.

1022
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,199
We, you know, there wasn't...

1023
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,830
There wasn't anything
that we wouldn't have done

1024
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,915
because we are
forever changed.

1025
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,584
[Laurette] I'm not saying that
we're um...

1026
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,963
we're not living because
we're surviving.

1027
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:17,926
That's what we're doing.
And for another parent,

1028
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,429
another sister, another brother
to have to do it,

1029
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,099
we don't want that.

1030
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:30,063
That's why we're willing to tell
this story to somebody.

1031
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:35,026
I don't want to watch somebody
else do what we're doing.

1032
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,375
[Jamie] There's a lot of forms
of brokenness on this planet

1033
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,794
that people are okay
talking about

1034
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,338
and for some reason
when it comes to depression,

1035
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,134
when it comes to self injury
or addiction or suicide

1036
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,929
these are things that are often
not talked about and we love

1037
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,266
the idea of that changing and
think that honesty is the

1038
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,561
beginning, honesty is really
contagious and disarming and

1039
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,938
has a way of letting people
know it's okay to go there

1040
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,232
and you're not alone
in how you feel.

1041
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:19,696
When you're in the midst of all
of this pain and insecurity

1042
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,199
and fear it can be hard to reach
out for help or even have

1043
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,746
a conversation with one of
your closest friends about

1044
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:32,334
what's going on in your own mind
and in your own feelings because

1045
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,587
it can be hard to value
yourself enough

1046
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,589
to receive the
help that you need.

1047
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,591
I'm glad I got help when I did

1048
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,135
but I wish I had gotten
help sooner

1049
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,429
maybe if I had things
wouldn't have gotten so bad.

1050
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,473
If I... If any of my children
ever went though something

1051
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,558
like that, I would um...

1052
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,353
definitely try to be as
emotionally available

1053
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,774
and just present as I could to
help them and then also get them

1054
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,693
any kind of professional help
that I was able to

1055
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,614
so they wouldn't have to
go through it on their own.

1056
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,575
I had the privilege of visiting
the White House about a

1057
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,913
year and a half ago and was part
of a group of about 150 people

1058
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,165
who work in the realm of
mental health and

1059
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,417
got to hear from the President
and the Vice President

1060
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,336
and all sorts of folks
were there and...

1061
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,547
and the day was really meant to
represent and indicate

1062
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,967
the idea that things were
changing and that this

1063
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:26,096
is a priority to the leaders of
this country and that it should

1064
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,683
be easier, it should be more
comfortable, more accessible

1065
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,976
for people to get help.

1066
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,229
Even though three quarters of
mental illnesses emerge by the

1067
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,899
end of... by the age of 24,

1068
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,360
only about half of children with
mental-health problems

1069
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,195
receive treatment.

1070
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,823
Now think about it,
we wouldn't accept it if

1071
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:51,121
only 40% of Americans with
cancers got treatment.

1072
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,081
We wouldn't accept it if only
half of young people with

1073
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,583
diabetes got help.

1074
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,086
Why should we accept it when it
comes to mental-health?

1075
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,963
Doesn't make any sense.

1076
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,009
In some cases when a condition
goes untreated it can lead to

1077
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,720
tragedy on a larger scale.

1078
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,265
We can do something about
stories like these.

1079
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,060
In many cases treatment is
available and effective.

1080
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,439
The awareness level has to be
higher, it has to be.

1081
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,316
There are... We hear it every
day, somebody got bullied

1082
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,152
to death or just gave up.

1083
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,281
It's an epidemic, it's a very
sad situation

1084
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,324
and it's avoidable,
it's preventable.

1085
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,910
It can take a few tries
to find something that works

1086
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,415
and it's a combination of
professional help, of therapy,

1087
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,501
of medication, and even
therapists. Sometimes you don't

1088
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,754
click with the first person you
talk to but it doesn't mean it's

1089
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,880
not gonna work.

1090
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,632
And outside of that, just
finding something in life that

1091
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,676
you're passionate about,
something that you can really

1092
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,888
work towards. For me that's
photography and music.

1093
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:54,726
If I looked back at myself when
I was 14, when I was depressed

1094
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:59,814
and struggling so much, I think
that girl would see me now and

1095
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,525
be amazed at what she's doing.

1096
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:06,488
I'm doing things now that when I
was 14 I wanted to do,

1097
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:11,201
I dreamed of doing, but I never

1098
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,578
took the steps to do it when I
was younger because I thought

1099
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:17,665
I couldn't. I've done music
photography and interviews with

1100
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,459
people that I never would have
dreamed of, some of the

1101
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,045
biggest artists in the world.
People I've looked up to for

1102
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:26,257
years and getting to photograph
these artists just makes

1103
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,009
everything come full circle.

1104
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:31,137
Finding my passion really
helped so much.

1105
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,098
It gives you something
to work for

1106
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,141
and it gives you a reason
to live.

1107
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,728
Just know that there are people
around that are gonna support

1108
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,730
you and are gonna help you,
you just need to find them

1109
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:46,569
and reach out to them 'cause
there are always people around

1110
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,697
that want to be there for you.
That want to help you.

1111
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,783
I didn't feel like I had anyone.

1112
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,785
I felt completely alone.

1113
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:58,164
I felt like I had no family,
no friends, no support

1114
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:02,627
but looking around
I really did.

1115
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:07,215
I... I had those people
and everyone does.

1116
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,260
You're helping them to see that
you're not alone, you have...

1117
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,680
And to finally see kids that
have gotten to a point

1118
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,974
where they say "My friends are
what saved my life."

1119
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,185
You know, "My support system is
what saved my life."

1120
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,436
That's why we do it.

1121
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,856
-[Jim] If you're not doing
anything to help your kid

1122
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,318
we would have loved that
opportunity.

1123
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,111
-[Laurette] There wasn't...
There wasn't anything...

1124
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,655
-[Jim] We don't have that
opportunity anymore.

1125
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,575
And if your child's in crisis

1126
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:39,789
and to the point of voluntary
or involuntary treatment,

1127
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:44,961
there should be no other option
because as a parent

1128
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:49,674
It's our belief, we were given
the gift of life with these

1129
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,510
children. They are not here for
us.

1130
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,181
We are here for them if they
are in crisis of any kind.

1131
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,100
It is our responsibility to do
the very best we can

1132
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,979
and if somebody comes and...
If one of your children come and

1133
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,566
blatantly tell you what
they're thinking.

1134
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,402
It is our responsibility as
parents to do everything

1135
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,363
possible to get them the help
that they deserve.

1136
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,450
I think honesty is contagious
and that so much of it starts

1137
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,661
there with just trying to create
environments and relationships

1138
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,540
and conversations where people
know that they can be honest

1139
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,460
about their struggles and
to stop painting a picture

1140
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,755
of this world where everyone's
okay all the time and...

1141
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,216
but that we're people and as
people we encounter pain,

1142
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,884
we encounter loss,

1143
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,429
we encounter depression and it's
okay to be honest about that.

1144
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:40,141
And I think that's how things
maybe begin to change is just

1145
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,102
creating an environment where we
go "Hey, if you need help,

1146
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,854
it's okay, it's part of
being human.

1147
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,148
It's okay to say
you need help.

1148
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:51,444
I know that I will always
struggle with depression.

1149
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,906
It's a part of me, but
it is not who I am.

1150
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,951
Although it can become
overwhelming some days

1151
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,454
and although some days the
symptoms feel like

1152
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,874
they're paralyzing me

1153
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:10,588
I've reached out enough to have
people to pull me out from

1154
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:15,093
that place to keep me from going
back into that dark place that

1155
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:20,473
that I reached before, and
although it is a rollercoaster

1156
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,851
I know that I will
make it through.
